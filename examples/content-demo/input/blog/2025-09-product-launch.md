# Introducing Meridian Workflow Studio

Today we are launching Workflow Studio, a new set of capabilities built to help your team move from insight to action faster. Meridian has always focused on operations intelligence: giving teams a clear view of where work is flowing, where risk is building, and where coordination is breaking down. Workflow Studio extends that foundation with practical workflow automation your team can control without heavy engineering support.

## What Is New

Workflow Studio includes three core features.

### 1) Trigger Maps
Trigger Maps let your team define conditions that start an automated action. For example, if order exceptions in a region exceed a threshold for two consecutive hours, we can notify the right owners, open a response workflow, and attach a prefilled context summary. You choose the conditions and escalation path.

### 2) Exception Inbox
Exception Inbox gives teams one queue for cross-system issues that need attention. Instead of chasing updates across tools, your team gets prioritized exception cards with root-cause hints, owner recommendations, and expected impact. The result is faster triage and cleaner accountability.

### 3) Playbook Templates
Playbook Templates provide reusable workflow automation patterns for common operations scenarios, including inventory delays, approval bottlenecks, and vendor SLA risk. Teams can start with a proven template, adapt it to local needs, and launch quickly.

## Why This Matters for Operations Leaders

Operations teams often face the same constraint: they can see problems, but they cannot respond consistently at scale. Workflow Studio closes that gap. With operations intelligence and workflow automation in one system, your team can move from diagnosis to action in minutes instead of days.

Early adopters in our design partner cohort reported three improvements after rollout:

- 31% faster exception resolution for recurring issue classes
- 24% reduction in manual coordination steps per incident
- 18% faster weekly planning cycles because fewer decisions were delayed by missing context

## Rollout Plan

Workflow Studio is available today for Pro and Enterprise plans. Starter teams can join the waitlist and access guided setup resources.

We recommend this rollout sequence:

1. Map one high-volume workflow with clear owners.
2. Configure Trigger Maps and Exception Inbox routing.
3. Pilot with one team for two weeks.
4. Review outcomes and expand playbook coverage.

Our customer success team will support each phase with onboarding sessions, template reviews, and metric checkpoints.

If your team is ready to reduce operational drag and execute with more consistency, we would love to show you Workflow Studio in a live demo.
