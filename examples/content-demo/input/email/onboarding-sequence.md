# Meridian Onboarding Email Sequence

## Email 1: Welcome and Setup
**Subject:** Welcome to Meridian - your first week plan

Hi there,

Welcome to Meridian. We are excited to help your team build better operational rhythm from day one.

In your first week, focus on three setup steps:

1. Connect your core systems so we can build a shared operations view.
2. Invite the team members who manage daily workflow handoffs.
3. Choose one high-impact process to track as your onboarding pilot.

By the end of this week, you should have a live dashboard with clear ownership and baseline metrics for cycle time and exception volume.

If you want help selecting a pilot workflow, reply to this email and we will recommend a starting point based on your goals.

Best,
The Meridian Team

## Email 2: Feature Introduction
**Subject:** Turn visibility into action with workflow automation

Hi there,

Now that your workspace is set up, let us help you move from insight to action.

This week, we recommend enabling one workflow automation that removes repetitive coordination work. A common first use case is exception triage: when a threshold is reached, we route the issue to the right owner with context attached.

To launch your first automation:

- Open Workflow Studio
- Pick a template for your pilot process
- Set owner routing and escalation timing
- Review outcomes after one week

Teams that start with one focused workflow usually see faster issue resolution and fewer manual status updates.

If you share your current bottleneck, we can suggest the best template.

Best,
The Meridian Team

## Email 3: 30-Day Check-In
**Subject:** 30-day check-in: what your team should measure next

Hi there,

You are about a month into Meridian, which is the right time to review outcomes and choose your next expansion area.

Start with these three questions:

- Did operations intelligence reduce time spent finding root causes?
- Did workflow automation reduce repetitive coordination tasks?
- Did your team make faster decisions in weekly planning?

If the answer is "partly," that is normal. Most teams improve in one area first, then scale patterns across additional workflows.

In your next month, we suggest adding one more team process and scheduling a quarterly benchmark review with us.

Reply if you want a guided optimization session. We are happy to help.

Best,
The Meridian Team
