**Subject:** Q4 update: new workflow automation tools and practical operations tips

Hi there,

Q4 was a strong quarter for product releases and customer outcomes. This issue covers what we shipped, what teams are learning, and what to try next in your own operations cadence.

## Product Updates from Q4

### Workflow Studio Expansion
We added new templates for procurement approvals, fulfillment exception routing, and SLA recovery. Teams can now launch workflow automation with fewer manual setup steps while still customizing ownership and escalation logic.

### Exception Inbox Improvements
Your team can now filter exceptions by business impact, age, and dependency risk. This helps operations leads run faster triage meetings with clearer prioritization.

### Benchmark Snapshots
Operations intelligence dashboards now include benchmark snapshots that compare current performance against your prior quarter. This makes trend discussions easier during planning reviews.

## What High-Performing Teams Are Doing

Across customer interviews this quarter, we saw three repeat practices:

- Teams set one shared metric set across operations, support, and finance.
- Teams start workflow automation with one process and expand after measurable gains.
- Teams run a weekly 20-minute exception review instead of scattered status checks.

These habits look simple, but they consistently improve execution quality.

## Quick Tip: Improve Handoff Clarity

If your team still loses context during handoffs, add a standard "next action + owner + deadline" note in every exception workflow. This small change can reduce rework and improve accountability quickly.

## Looking Ahead

In Q1, we will release deeper planning views and additional automation templates for complex cross-team workflows. If you want early access, reply to this newsletter and we will add your team to the preview list.

Thanks for being part of our community.
