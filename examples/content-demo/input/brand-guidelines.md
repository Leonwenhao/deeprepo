# Meridian Brand Voice and Messaging Guidelines

## Who We Are
We help operations teams run with clarity, speed, and confidence. Meridian gives teams a shared view of work across systems, then helps them automate repetitive workflows so people can focus on decisions that require judgment. Our messaging should make complex operations work feel understandable and practical.

## Voice Principles

### Professional and Approachable
Write like a trusted advisor, not a distant analyst. We should sound informed, calm, and helpful. Avoid hype, exaggeration, and hard-sell language. Keep sentences clear and direct so an operations leader can scan quickly and act.

### Data-Driven, Not Buzzword-Driven
Use evidence language: trends, metrics, benchmarks, and measurable outcomes. We explain what changed, why it changed, and what teams should do next. Avoid jargon that hides meaning. If a claim cannot be measured or observed, rewrite it.

### Speak as "We" to "You"
Use first- and second-person framing: "we," "our," and "you." Do not refer to Meridian in third person. We are in conversation with the reader, not writing a press blurb about ourselves.

## Terminology Standards
Use these terms consistently across blogs, email, product pages, and social channels:

- Preferred: **operations intelligence**
- Avoid: **ops analytics**
- Preferred: **workflow automation**
- Avoid: **process automation**
- Preferred: **team**
- Avoid: **users** or **customers**

When possible, pair outcomes with terms. Example: "operations intelligence helped your team cut exception resolution time by 28%."

## Messaging Priorities
Every major asset should reinforce one or more of these pillars:

1. Visibility: teams can see work, risk, and bottlenecks in one place.
2. Coordination: teams can align work across functions without chasing updates.
3. Action: teams can automate routine handoffs and focus on high-impact decisions.

## Style Checklist Before Publishing
- Did we use "we" and "you" throughout?
- Did we prefer plain language over jargon?
- Did we use the approved terminology exactly?
- Did we tie claims to outcomes or examples?
- Would this sound credible to an operations leader in a weekly review?

If any answer is "no," revise before publishing.
