Two characters (Rose and Chris) share intimate embrace moment.

Time of Day: UNKNOWN
Cast: Chris; Jim Hudson; Jeremy; Derrick
Props: Glass (that Jim holds up for fist bump); Seeing eye dog (for Jim)
Animals: Seeing eye dog (guide dog for blind character Jim Hudson)
Set Dressing: Gazebo (main location - practical structure with seating area); No additional furniture or decorations specified
Production Notes: Exterior daytime scene at gazebo. Scene requires: 1) blind actor portrayal - may need coordination with blind consultant; 2) seeing eye dog - requires animal handler and proper training/acclimate period; 3) fist bump with glass prop - needs safe, breakaway version; 4) scene occurs during Dean's speech in background - may need to capture audio bleed or control background noise; 5) multiple character blocking - Chris wandering from group, Jim positioned in gazebo away from main gathering; 6) dialogue-heavy scene with emotional beats between Chris and Jim regarding art, blindness, and photography.

Production Notes: Daytime interior scene. Key dramatic element: guests' fake conversations stop simultaneously when Chris is out of earshot - requires precise timing in performance and editing. Blocking note: guests need to be arranged in "small groups" throughout the room to allow Chris to slip past. The reveal that conversations were fake is central to the scene's tension - actors playing guests must maintain awareness throughout while appearing to converse naturally.
