# Brand Voice Guidelines

Our voice should be clear, direct, and helpful. Use active language, short
sentences, and concrete examples whenever possible. Favor specificity over
claims, and explain tradeoffs when recommendations involve cost, effort, or
risk.

Write for busy readers. Lead with the main point, then provide supporting
detail in logical order. Avoid vague phrases, heavy jargon, and unnecessary
superlatives. Keep tone confident and practical, and make next steps easy to
act on in a single pass.
