The September launch campaign will run in three waves: awareness, proof, and conversion. In awareness, we publish a concise narrative about the product problem and our unique approach. In proof, we release customer examples, implementation notes, and performance comparisons. In conversion, we send segmented offers with clear next actions.

Launch readiness depends on aligned messaging, stable analytics tagging, and a shared response plan for common objections. We will monitor engagement daily and adjust copy, channel mix, and call-to-action placement based on observed behavior.
