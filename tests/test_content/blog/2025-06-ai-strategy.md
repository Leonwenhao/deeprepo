Our AI strategy for the second half of the year focuses on practical adoption over novelty. We will prioritize customer-facing workflows where turnaround time and consistency matter most, including support response drafting, campaign variant generation, and content repurposing for channel-specific audiences. Each initiative must define baseline metrics before rollout, then measure quality, cycle time, and cost.

We will also invest in governance: prompt templates, review checklists, and a release cadence for model updates. Teams should pilot quickly, document lessons, and standardize only after measurable wins.
