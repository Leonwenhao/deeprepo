Written by Jordan Peele
(Test excerpt - not actual screenplay)


FADE IN:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

A quiet, tree-lined street. ANDRE HAYWORTH walks alone.

                      ANDRE
            Nah, nah, nah. I am not about to
            get lost in this...

A car slowly follows him. Andre notices. He turns.

                      ANDRE (CONT'D)
            Come on...

INT. CHRIS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

CHRIS WASHINGTON, late 20s, packs a bag.

                      CHRIS
            You sure it's cool, me coming?

                      ROSE (O.S.)
            Yeah, of course!

INT./EXT. ROSE'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

ROSE drives. CHRIS rides passenger. A DEER darts into the road.

                      ROSE
            Oh my god!

The car SWERVES. Impact. The deer lies in the road.

EXT. ARMITAGE ESTATE - DAY

The car pulls up a long driveway. A grand house sits on manicured grounds. DEAN ARMITAGE and MISSY ARMITAGE wait on the porch.

                      DEAN
            Welcome! Chris, we are so happy
            to have you.

INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Missy sits across from Chris. A TEACUP AND SPOON on the table between them.

                      MISSY
            Let me help you with your
            smoking habit.

She stirs the teacup. The spoon CLINKS against porcelain.

FADE OUT.
